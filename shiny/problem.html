  <h2>The Problem: Justice Delayed is Justice Denied</h2>
    <p> The Emergency Assistance (EA) program, run by the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), is a shelter system for families and pregnant women experiencing homelessness in Massachusetts. Garcia vs. DHCD is an ongoing class action lawsuit that was first filed in 2016 by Greater Boston Legal Services, ACLU, and Ropes & Gray on behalf of homeless families. The lawsuit claims DHCD violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by failing to promptly accommodate the the disabilities of homeless individuals.</p>
      
    <p> In 2018, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that more information was necessary to determine whether DHCD unreasonably delays implementing ADA accommodations it approves, and whether these delays are a result of DHCD's policy of transferring EA participants with disabilities only when "administratively feasible."</p>
    
  <h2>The Question</h2>
  
    <b><i>What percentage of approved disability requests are actually met? How long does it take DHCD to implement these approved accommodations? Is this happening within a reasonable timeframe? Do certain types of accommodations result in longer delays?</i></b> 
    
    <p>The goal of this project is to answer these questions using data on ADA requests (individual applications for disability accommodations), transfers within the shelter system, and characteristics of various shelter locations. This data was provided by the DHCD and ranges from 2015-2019. I hope to provide a basic characterization of the ADA requests dataset by mapping out the most frequently requested disability accommodations and most frequently approved disability accommodations. Unfortunately, the provided data is insufficient to confidently answer the above question. By making certain assumptions, I attempt to calculate average delays in disability accommodation. Using data visualization and statistical analysis, I hope to provide commentary on the data that I have aquired.</p>

  <h2>Explaining Our Data Assumptions</h2>
  <p>
    <b>There were several obstacles to this data analysis:</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the data provided by DHCD are insufficient to directly answer the above question. 70% of values are missing for the date each approved request was met. Given that I have no information about if/when/how approved accommodations were met 70% of the time, I make several reasonable assumptions to deduce this information: 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Only show unit type accommodations:</b> Since I have information about where and when individuals were transferred within the EA Shelter system, I am able to deduce the date an accommodation was met for accommodations that <i>require an internal or external transfer</i> to be met. This refers to the following accommodations: proximity to service providers, scattered site/co-housing, first floor/elevator access, wheelchair accessibility. 
    
    Because I currently lack information about the zipcode of service providers, I look only at the following unit-type accommodations: scattered site/co-housing, first floor/elevator access, wheelchair accessibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Substitute missing values with transfer:</b> For requests that include a unit type accommodation, I use data on shelter characteristics to determine if a transfer that occurred after the initial request met the disability need. If a transfer meets the need, I substitute missing values for the date an accommodation was met with the date of transfer. 
  </p>
  
   <p>
     <b>Assume hotel transfers meet unit type accommodations:</b> Since I have no information on hotel characteristics, I make the assumption that a hotel meets all unit type accommodations.
